# Semester Project 2 – List It Auction Website

## Description

**List It** is an online auction platform where users can **list items for sale** and **bid on items** added by other users.  
Newly registered users start with **1000 credits**, which they can use to bid on items.  
Credits can be earned by selling items and spent by placing bids.

The goal of this project was to build a functional auction site using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, working with a REST API to fetch, display, and manage auction data dynamically.
